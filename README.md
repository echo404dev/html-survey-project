# html-survey-project
This is my take on the freeCodeCamp Survey Form project.  
It's a simple HTML form that helped me understand structure, input types, and accessibility.

I built this as part of my learning journey, and I'm proud of every line â€” even the ones I had to rewrite 10 times ðŸ˜…

## What I Learned

- How to use input types like text, email, and number
- The purpose of `id`, `label`, and `placeholder`
- That forms are trickier than they look ðŸ˜¤
- How to troubleshoot using test feedback

## Built With

- HTML5
- Patience
- A bit of ChatGPT (yep, I'm not gonna lie)
